This is a fun little game you can play with your computer! When you run the program, it asks you to pick one of three things: stone, paper, or scissors.

After you make your choice, the computer randomly picks one as well. Then, the program compares your choice with the computer's and tells you who wins, following the classic rules:

Stone beats scissors

Scissors beat paper

Paper beats stone

If you both pick the same thing, it’s a tie

If you type something that’s not "stone", "paper", or "scissors", the program lets you know it’s an invalid choice.

Basically, it’s a quick and simple way to play Stone, Paper, Scissors against your computer!
